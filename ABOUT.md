- **Full Stack**: Everything you need, optimized

### 2. **Performance First**

## 👥 Who Is This For?

### Perfect For:
✅ **Multi-Project Developers**: Working on frontend, backend, and mobile simultaneously
✅ **Consultants**: Switching between client projects with different tech stacks

### Not Ideal For:
❌ **Vim Purists**: If you prefer raw Vim without plugins
❌ **IDE Die-Hards**: If you're committed to VSCode/IntelliJ
❌ **Beginners**: If you've never used Vim/Neovim before (try our minimal profile first!)
